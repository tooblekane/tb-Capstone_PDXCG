# GameBot

The aim of this website is to give patient (or lazy) gamers one spot to find sale information on games they
have been interested in, but haven't yet purchased.  Compare prices across different digital storefronts,
track price history, and see scheduled upcoming sales, all in one site, to determine if they can finally
justify spending the money.



            
## Features

- Links to each major store with current price displayed
- Historical sale information letting you know if this sale is worthwhile or not, or if the current price is the lowest it has ever been
- Filter games by store, price, and discount amount
